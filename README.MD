This is a simple React application that allows users to submit their name and email, which are then sent to a Node.js API using Axios. The API stores the submitted data in a list hosted on the server and returns a response indicating the success or failure of the operation. The app is built using Vite.

 The app handles CORS on the Node.js server, allowing it to be accessed from any domain.
